1930	4535	Apprenticeship scaffolder (m/f/d)	"If you want to become a master, practice early on" - That also applies to you, because you liked to climb trees even as a child. And even today you are always at the start when it comes to dizzying heights. If you also want to aim high professionally and enjoy working outdoors, then training as a scaffolder could be just the right thing for you. Because here you climb step by step every day and are not afraid to work at this height.

The training to become a scaffolder lasts three years. Both the inter-company training and the theoretical training in the vocational schools take place in blocks in Dortmund, with the trainees being accommodated in the boarding school. In the first year of your apprenticeship you will first be taught all the necessary safety measures, because training to become a scaffolder is not for the faint-hearted. Every day you have to rely on your colleagues doing their work properly and each one completing their work step carefully - this also applies to you, of course! A loose screw can have serious consequences.
