The entire castle complex has three spacious event rooms, the largest of which can seat up to 250 guests. The combination of the historic building walls paired with a modern interior design and a bright, friendly ambience make our premises the ideal venue for events of all kinds? whether weddings, company events or birthdays. In addition to the event rooms, Heimerzheim Castle offers a total of 21 comfortable hotel rooms, which enable guests to spend the night in a modern castle hotel. After an almost two-year forced break due to the damage caused by the flood disaster in July 2021, we are now looking forward to finally starting again in April in freshly renovated premises, with full order books and an expanded team.
