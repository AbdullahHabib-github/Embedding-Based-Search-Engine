Unconsumed French fries from the restaurant or expired yoghurt from the supermarket shelf - in terms of sustainability, as an innovative disposal company, ReFood only uses organic materials that are no longer used in the food chain. Every year, ReFood collects around 500,000 tons of food and leftovers in Germany alone and uses them as sustainable raw materials to generate electricity, gas and heat of the 2nd generation in its own biogas plants. Energy from nuclear power and hard coal can be replaced in this way and many thousands of tons of CO2 can be saved every year.	2023-03-07 15:51:10.273000
