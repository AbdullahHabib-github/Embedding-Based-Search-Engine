8056	10661	Commis de Rank Restaurant Aqua (3 Michelin Sterne) (m/f/d)	The cuisine at Aqua is impressively simple and sophisticated at the same time. Sven Elverfeld stands for the creative style of cooking. His modern European cuisine focuses on the harmony of the textures and the inherent taste of the highest quality ingredients. The creations themselves often amaze with a deliberately simple, often almost trivial naming such as ?Forelle ?LÃ¼neburger Heide? & Smoke Brandade?. But at the latest the interpretation of the seemingly everyday causes a surprise. And the consumption for pleasure! ?We are Ladies and Gentlemen serving Ladies and Gentlemen?
