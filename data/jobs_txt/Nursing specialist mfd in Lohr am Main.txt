239	2844	Nursing specialist (m/f/d) in Lohr am Main	At advita, it is important to us that we have enough time for our clients. With a job in our day care, this is particularly easy because we have enough staff here to respond well to the needs of our guests. The stress that one knows from some nursing homes is foreign to us, working in elderly care is more fun and our clients feel comfortable and well cared for.

In addition, of course, there is the huge advantage of day care: Regulated working hours without weekend or even night shifts. That is why day care is particularly popular with our colleagues who have family or other private commitments.

For our branch in Lohr am Main, we are looking for a nurse (m/f/d) for day care as soon as possible.
 The position is part-time (20 hours/week).
