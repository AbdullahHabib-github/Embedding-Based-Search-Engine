In the project in Stendal you coach the job-seeking participants on an outreach basis or at the gsm location. In this project, we would also like to focus on the topic of health and encourage the participants to adopt an exercise-, health- and nutrition-oriented lifestyle in the long term.
The concept of this project gives you the freedom to work holistically, individually and creatively with the participants. For us, coaching means that the participants get back to doing things themselves and thus experience self-efficacy. This is how gsm works – do it yourself together.
