WHAT YOU DO WITH US
It is clear that cashing in and storing goods are part of retail. You have a knack for an attractive presentation of goods and also take care of the order in the branch. And if the team management is not in the branch, you can keep track of the shift schedules and the processes in the branch!

WHAT TO BRING
You already know that things can get a little hectic in retail and it is precisely then that you keep an overview. Above all, you want to lend a hand and make our branch a place where our customers (m/f/d) like to come back.

WE MAKE SURE OF THAT
The most important things first: A secure job with a permanent contract - and a great team that supports and trains you.
And if you ever want to take on new tasks or take on more responsibility, we would be happy to give you the chance.

DO YOU HAVE ANYMORE QUESTIONS?
Please feel free to call your contact person (m/f/d). Our colleagues (m/f/d) can be reached Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.
