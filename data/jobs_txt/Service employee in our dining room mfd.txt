The medical-therapeutic range of indications is very diverse and includes, among other things, psychosomatic-psychovegetative diseases, metabolic diseases such as obesity, respiratory diseases, skin diseases and diseases of the heart and circulatory system. Selected focus treatments tailored to specific target groups round off the holistic therapeutic offer.

An important part of this is the oncological rehabilitation measure "getting well together" supported by the Rexrodt von Fircks Foundation for mothers and their children suffering from breast cancer.

A team of around 140 employees in the fields of medicine, therapy, administration, the hotel industry and child and youth care work hand in hand for the benefit of patients big and small.
