7140	9745	Business Intelligence & Reporting Developer (m/w/d)	Location: 50933 Cologne & home office | Contract type: full-time, unlimited | Job ID: 780096


What we plan to do together:

Together with you and your cross-functional, agile team, we create the single point of truth for all control-relevant key figures in retail Germany (REWE, PENNY and other companies). We actively shape the data architecture in which the data from the diverse system world of the company is bundled. On the basis of this foundation, we create a reporting platform for all levels of management as the modern heart of controlling in the digital age. We work in an overarching agile construct with several product teams and the other departments of controlling in retail Germany.


Whether you want to work from one of our regional offices within Germany, our central office in Cologne or remotely: the choice is yours. No matter what you decide, our way of working is designed to make you an integral part of the team! Are you an early riser or rather a late riser? Our New Work mentality enables you to schedule your working hours independently, flexibly and without core working hours.


What you do with us:

You know how to understand numbers, bits and bytes and like to work on complex problems. Do you want to form a product together with the team that generates added value throughout the company? Then you will find what you are looking for with us! Because as a BI & Reporting Developer, you drive the transformation of our reporting and are responsible for the further development of the single point of truth for retail in Germany within the REWE Group.

- You show commitment: You record, cut and document requirements and business processes in exchange with the team and the product owner and accompany the complete product development cycle.
- You are right in the middle: You create the application documentation and train all necessary users in the operation of the product.
- Your ideas for the future: You continue to develop the product through refactoring, code reviews and user feedback, taking into account the defined quality gates. In addition, you independently develop ideas for new analysis approaches, analysis tools and interactive reports in MicroStrategy.
- Achieve more together: As part of our interdisciplinary team, you are responsible for UX, design and the development of reports and dashboards.
- As a data whisperer, you support the PO in the administration of the product (e.g. cost controlling and allocation, commissioning external services, annual planning).
- You lend a hand: The documentation and testing of our BI application are just as much a part of it as the processing of support tickets and the creation of ad hoc analyses.
- You enjoy advising customers on the right methods and technologies and you take responsibility for the implementation of product requirements.
- The professional exchange as well as assistance inside and outside the product are the be-all and end-all for you.
