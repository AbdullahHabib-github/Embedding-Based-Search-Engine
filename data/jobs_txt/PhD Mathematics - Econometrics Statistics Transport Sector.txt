Research Associate (m/f/x)
(subject to personal qualification employees are remunerated according to salary group E 13 TV-L)

starting as soon as possible. The position comprises 75% of the fulltime weekly hours and is limited to 3 years. The period of employment is governed by the Fixed Term Research Contracts Act (Wissenschaftszeitvertragsgesetz-WissZeitVG). The position offers the chance to obtain further academic qualification (e.g. PhD). Research work to fulfill below-listed objectives. Own research activities as well as publications in international journals are explicitly desired and expected. The following goals are to be advanced within the framework of a DFG project:

	Develop estimators of the higher realized moments of daily returns based on the high-frequency data.
	Estimate the conditional distribution of the daily returns and forecast it. Based on moment estimation, to derive an ex-post approximation of the conditional distribution of returns based on intra-day information.
	Develop a model to predict future ex-post density approximations. Using the modified CAViaR model in which the quantile regression takes realized skewness and kurtosis into account, we aim at a simultaneous estimation of ES and VaR.
 university degree in statistics, econometrics or mathematics; profound knowledge of modern programming and a suitable language, e.g., Python or R; knowledge of data analysis, ability to work independently in a goal- and project-oriented manner. Knowledge in stochastic processes and financial econometrics is advantageous.	mathematician	None	2023-03-07 15:57:51.673000
