this is us
The LEOS Brasserie Leipzig is located right in the center of Leipzig city centre.
Our guests can stay in two guest rooms, a non-smoking room and a smoking room.
There is also enough space for larger groups, we recommend a reservation here.
Our guests can relax and enjoy the summer on our patio under large shady trees.
Our kitchen offers our guests a menu with regional and international dishes. Our guests can choose regional or international drinks from our drinks menu.
From 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. we like to spoil our guests with cocktails, which we then offer at a reduced price. Of course we offer cocktails during the entire opening hours.
