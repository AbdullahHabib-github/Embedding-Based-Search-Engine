Equal opportunity is not only a legal obligation for job advertisements. The equality of all employees, regardless of gender, origin, age, skin color, ideology, religion, disability or sexual identity is an essential part of the self-image and corporate culture of the employer.
Severely disabled applicants will be given preference if they are equally qualified.	Specialist - Neurology	None	2023-03-07 15:51:03.142000
