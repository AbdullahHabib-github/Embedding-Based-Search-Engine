General student internship in mechanical and plant engineering

Your tasks:
It won't be long before you'll have finished school - but it's still unclear in which direction you want to go? Don't worry, most people your age feel the same way.
Our tip: Just do a general internship first for orientation. In this way you can find out whether you are more interested in technology or more in economics.

We have many exciting departments in which you can get a taste of practical work and get to know the day-to-day business of a successful company. Find out which area interests you and where your strengths and interests lie. There is something for everyone. This way you can test yourself and get to know yourself better. You'll see it's fun. And you might even find your dream job.
