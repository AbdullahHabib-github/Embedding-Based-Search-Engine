3909	6514	ISA KOMPASS: social worker - educator - healer ...	Introduction
-----------------------------------------------------
 
The special help is an inpatient and outpatient offer from ISA KOMPASS GmbH, which was created in cooperation with the city of Gera in recent years and is available for the city of Gera. The inpatient setting offers a home to two young people between the ages of 12 and 18. The focus here is on accepting and enduring the various behavioral problems. The help is tailored to the needs of the young people. Furthermore, there is an ISPE clearing place in the inpatient area. This setting is limited in time and is intended to avoid the cycle of repeated help terminations until a connection perspective is found.
