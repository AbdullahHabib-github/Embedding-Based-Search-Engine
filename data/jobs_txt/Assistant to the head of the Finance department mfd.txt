About Us:

As a municipal service provider, the city of Wolfenbüttel takes care of public affairs in the entire city area. With around 1,000 employees and its annual turnover, the “City of Wolfenbüttel Group” can be compared to a large business enterprise. In contrast to such a company, the city administration does not produce a product, but works on a colorful bouquet of topics for the citizens of Wolfenbüttel day after day.

Due to an organizational recommendation, the city administration is in a comprehensive restructuring process. As part of this, it is planned to bundle the finance, human resources and organizational areas of administration in one department and thus control all internal management and service areas together. In addition to the Office of Finance, the Department of Internal Services will also be located in the department in the future. The Human Resources and Organisation, IT, Central Registration Office and Central Service departments are assigned to the Internal Services department. By bundling the internal management and service areas, the area of ​​responsibility of the assistant will also change in terms of content.

Are you motivated to support the department management in exciting and varied tasks?
Then we look forward to receiving your application documents!
