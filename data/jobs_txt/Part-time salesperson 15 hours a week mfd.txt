WHAT YOU DO WITH US
Of course, in retail the checkout is your priority, but putting away the goods is also part of your job. Of course, you also take care of order in our branch. Doesn't sound too complicated - it's not!

WHAT TO BRING
Do you already have experience in sales or trade? Great - but it's not necessary. It is much more important that you want to get involved and that you enjoy doing it. For all other tasks, your colleagues (m/f/d) will of course be at your side.

WE MAKE SURE OF THAT
The most important things first: A secure job with a permanent contract - and a great team that supports and trains you.
And if you ever want to take on new tasks or take on more responsibility, we would be happy to give you the chance.

DO YOU HAVE ANYMORE QUESTIONS?
Please feel free to call your contact person (m/f/d). Our colleagues (m/f/d) can be reached Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.

Don't wait, apply now!	Saleswoman	None	2023-03-07 15:58:19.562000
