223	2828	PhD-student to work on adoptive T cell therapy of cancer	Scope of duties

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has become the gold standard for several hematological malignancies. The scope of indications of this therapeutic modality is rapidly expanding with promising studies being launched also in solid tumors. Simultaneously, research in the CAR T cell field also has a strong focus on toxicity mechanisms, treatment and prevention thereof. CAR T cell therapy is a living therapy infused in patients which will remain active and in circulation for decades. Conventional pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies are not apropriate for this therapeutic modality and there is an urge for pre-clinical models that can be used to extensively test these therapies. This PhD position will focus on the study of CAR T cell therapies.
The working group offers an exciting scientific environment with young international colleagues. This PhD position will be integrated in existing PhD programs in the Division for Clinical Pharmacology (Director: Prof. S. Endres; www.klinische-pharmakologie.de). The Division for Clinical Phamacology works on an internationally competitive level on topics concerning innate immunity and tumor immunology
