As an inpatient youth welfare facility in the heart of Krefeld, we are on duty around the clock for needy children and young people who cannot live at home permanently or temporarily. We give them a safe space to process the experiences they have made and to come to rest.

At 84 stationary youth welfare places in 10 residential groups, we offer children, young people and their parents differentiated help on the basis of §§ 34 and 41 of SGB VIII. More than 90 employees work on our campus-like premises.

We at the Marianum stand for practiced charity. We help children, young people and families in difficult situations. Unbureaucratic, professional and fast.

The institution responsible for the facilities is the Catholic Poor Administration, a church foundation under private law. It was founded in 1755, has been running a children's home since 1857 and acts independently of the influence of the Catholic Church.

In addition, we run our own day care center with 45 places, where children from the neighborhood and from the Marianum are cared for.
