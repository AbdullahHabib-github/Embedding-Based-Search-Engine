## Description of the job

The LCCM & Logistic Simulation department is part of the Project, Logistics and Costs department in the Defense & Security division. We develop cross-departmental, individual, customer-oriented software solutions for the management of large-scale technical projects. You design the interface between our customers and the team in software development with commitment and responsibility.

## Task

- You model excerpts from reality, e.g. the logistics of an aircraft fleet or the processes in a hospital, in order to be able to simulate and forecast reality. You will make a significant contribution to the simulation-based determination of performance limits and bottlenecks of a system and to the evaluation of different conceivable measures for our customers in the defense sector
- Through your structured, analytical and effective way of working, you model logistical processes that depict, for example, the use, maintenance and repair of technical systems
- With your communication skills and your motivation to constantly develop yourself, you will work with your colleagues in logistical simulation and data analysis as well as our customers to develop solutions to complex issues
- You create, visualize, interpret, evaluate and present simulation results for our customers and other stakeholders
- You will take over the sub-project management for the topic of simulation within large technical consulting projects
- You carry out cost and effort estimates as well as time planning

- You are interested and would like to have experience in optimizing software development processes
- You have a soft spot for complex algorithms
- You are willing to familiarize yourself with logistical topics such as maintenance, repair and servicing of complex systems
- Ideally, you have already worked intensively with a simulation environment such as AnyLogic, SimPy, Plant Simulation or Witness
- You have experience in using tools in an agile environment such as JIRA and Confluence to control and document development
- Working in an international team in German and English is a matter of course for you

## Goals

Our team supports our customers in the area of ​​life cycle cost management and logistic simulation with advanced methods, applications and expertise. We offer our customers excellent consulting services across all phases of the product life cycle for complex technical systems.	Application programmer	None	2023-03-07 15:58:53.885000
