Vacation and working hours: At SWR we work 39 hours a week. You get 31 days of vacation per year. You will also receive 10 extra exam days to prepare for your final exam.

Discounted job ticket: As a public broadcaster, we have a special responsibility - also in relation to our environment. That's why we offer you attractive mobility measures. This includes, for example, a discounted job ticket for using public transport at the three main locations in Baden-Baden, Mainz and Stuttgart.

Discounts in the canteen: Since we know that money is often tight, especially these days, we offer our young apprentices fair discounts in our canteens at our main locations in Baden-Baden, Mainz and Stuttgart.
