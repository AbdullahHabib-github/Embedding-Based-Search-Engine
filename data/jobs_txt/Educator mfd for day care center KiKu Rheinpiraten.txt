3465	6070	Educator (m/f/d) for day care center "KiKu Rheinpiraten"	Are you looking for a cosmopolitan language daycare center with kindergarten and crèche groups? And you want to be an integral part of an open and friendly team?

Great, then you've come to the right place with the KiKu Rhine Pirates! Because we are looking for you as a pedagogical specialist (m/f/d) full-time or part-time (20 - 40 hours/week).

On board the Rhine Pirates you can develop your pedagogical knowledge, grow steadily and sail over even the roughest waters together with the team and the children.

The day care center is located near Dormagen and Neuss. The location of the day care center is excellent, as our excursions can take place in a wide variety of places. Whether shopping together in the Worringen district, relaxing and exploring nature in the forest or immersing yourself in the urban jungle by public transport. Together with the children we enjoy the advantages of the big city and at the same time the advantages of a suburb

You don't have to be perfect, but you are motivated to contribute all your strengths to our team. And you want one thing above all: to enable children to have the best of all daycare times and to accompany them on their way to becoming self-determined and responsible personalities.
