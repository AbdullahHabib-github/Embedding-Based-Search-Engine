We offer experience, goal orientation and reliability

It is no coincidence that our district head office has existed since 1996. This is thanks to our experience, our goal orientation and also our reliability. Our loyal customers appreciate these qualities as well as our detailed, individual and innovative advice on all their insurance and financial issues. It is important to us that our customers don't just see us as just some insurance guy, but rather as a partner they can trust. Constant further education and training, our experience and our commitment to our customers are probably our greatest strengths. We proceed according to the principle that only when our customers are satisfied, then we are too.

We are looking for employees who understand this basic attitude and know how to implement it in day-to-day business with our customers. Emphatic and trusting cooperation is our focus - with our customers and our team.
