3568	6173	Master Thesis Computer Science - Digital Transformation	We offer twelve Master thesis positions on the topic "Digital Transformation in Medicine" located at Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.

The master projects are collaborative projects between a computer science/data science master student and a medical student within the graduate program DigiStrucMed. The projects may start between June 1st 2023 and February 1st 2024 and have a duration of 6 months.

DigiStrucMed
The Else Kröner graduate program "Digital Transformation in Medicine" (DigiStrucMed) is a structured doctorate and graduate program of Hannover Biomedical Research School with the 3rd program year starting in Summer 2023. The program is funded by Else Kröner Fresenius-Stiftung and is a cooperation project between Hannover Medical School (MHH), Peter L. Reichertz Institute for Medical Informatics of TU Braunschweig and MHH (PLRI), the research institute L3S of Leibniz University Hannover and the University of Applied Sciences and Arts Hannover (Hs-H). Master students of computer science and related fields work together with doctoral students of medicine on an interdisciplinary research project to answer questions related to the topic \\"Digital Transformation in Medicine\\".
