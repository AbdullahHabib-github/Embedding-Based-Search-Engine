240	2845	Nursing manager (m/f/d) in Lohr am Main	In our advita houses, we look after our clients in their own apartments or shared rooms, just like on an outpatient tour. Because these rooms and apartments are all in the advita building, we naturally have no problems with traffic jams, parking spaces or bad weather.

The really big advantage in the advita house, however, is that care for the elderly does not have to be done quickly and quickly because we have fewer clients for one caregiver than in many other facilities. Colleagues who previously worked in a hospital or nursing home particularly appreciate this.

The short distances in the house also save time, which we can spend with the client instead of in the car. In addition, professional caregivers and housekeeping staff relieve us of a lot of the work. In this way, we can respond very well to the needs and wishes of our clients in our advita houses. The work is more fun and our clients feel good.
