- In addition, you conduct tenant discussions, accompany construction meetings and optimize the agreed cost and quality targets while specifying the schedule
- You take on the role of client representative for notifiable measures and clarify building and planning law requirements with the Federal Railway Authority
- You are also responsible for reporting and controlling all tenant conversions
- You coordinate the handover of a group-compliant documentation of the tenant documents to the station management

- Ideally, you have initial experience in the realization of projects and in tenant building management
- You are very familiar with common software applications such as MS Office
- You look forward to working in a team and the cohesion among colleagues is important to you
- You can clearly communicate your point of view without losing sight of the needs of others

* Fascinating projects and tasks - from exciting regional infrastructure measures to the largest construction sites in Europe - demand your skills and are waiting for your handwriting.
* You achieve great things and get nothing less in return: a salary package that is customary in the market, usually with permanent employment contracts and job security, as well as a wide range of fringe benefits and a company pension scheme.
* We promote flexible, individual working time models and support, where operationally possible, with modern forms of work such as home office or mobile working.
