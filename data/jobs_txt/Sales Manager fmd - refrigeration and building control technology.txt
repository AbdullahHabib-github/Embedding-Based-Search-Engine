3953	6558	Sales Manager (f/m/d) - refrigeration and building control technology	Introduction
-----------------------------------------------------
 
Eckelmann AG, based in Wiesbaden, is a medium-sized automation partner for machine, device and plant construction. Your focus is on the development and series production of optimized control solutions for machines as well as the system integration and programming of control and automation systems.
The refrigeration and building control technology division provides the European market with one of the leading control systems for commercial refrigeration systems. The automation of refrigeration systems in supermarkets and cold stores is just as much a part of the range of services as the automation of commercial buildings. The connection of the building to an efficient, higher-level building control system and the modern services round off the portfolio. Customers include European market leaders in the construction of refrigeration systems and refrigerated cabinets, craft businesses, engineering and planning offices as well as general contractors and project developers.
Our sales managers enjoy meeting new people every day and maintain contact with our existing customers with the same joy. They can convincingly explain complicated technical contexts to our customers. They love challenges and know that they can count on the support of their colleagues and managers.
If you feel addressed, enjoy selling and would like to contribute your personality and skills to our team, then look no further. Apply to be a Sales Manager (f/m/d) at Eckelmann AG Kälte- und Gebäudeleittechnik. We look forward to seeing you.
