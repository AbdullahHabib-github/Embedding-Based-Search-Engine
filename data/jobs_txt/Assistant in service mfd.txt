Benissimo's - Italian. Authentic. Good. -
Italian. Authentic. Good. - With us, the name says it all.
True to our motto, we send our guests on a culinary journey through Italy.
In Italy there is no subject that is discussed and argued about as long as food. It's not just about the pure intake of food, it's about the selection of the individual ingredients and of course the right preparation.
Pizza, pasta, insalate e dolci are homemade; because we want to pass our standards on to our guests.

Our dishes are characterized by fresh and regional ingredients, natural taste and quality. Of course, the Italian flair and the season should not be missing here. We regularly offer new and special food variations. You are also cordially invited to contribute your ideas.
We are a family business with many years of gastronomic experience. We offer our employees a friendly and modern working atmosphere with the opportunity to develop personally. Ideas and suggestions for new dishes, variations or optimizations are welcome.
Family is very important in Italy. Even if it's not about work, we make time for you.

Our restaurant is located in the center of Bornheim and can be easily reached from Cologne / Bonn and the surrounding area by car (sufficient parking space available), bicycle and tram (bus stop is in the immediate vicinity of the restaurant).
We cordially invite you to become a part of the Benissimo`s family and to bring a piece of Italy into the world.	Service staff - gastronomy and hospitality	None	2023-03-07 15:50:56.684000
