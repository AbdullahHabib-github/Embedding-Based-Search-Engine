3557	6162	PhD Student Chemistry, Food Chemistry - Dermatology (m/f/d)	The German Cancer Research Center is the largest biomedical research institution in Germany. With approximately 3,000 employees, we operate an extensive scientific program in the field of cancer research.

Together with university partners at seven renowned partner sites, we have established the German Cancer Consortium (DKTK).

For the DKTK partner site Essen / DÃ¼sseldorf the German Cancer Research Center is seeking a
PhD Student - Assay Development for the AHR Signature in Dermatology
(Ref-No. 2023-0055)

The PredictAHR project utilizes existing data from the German Cancer Consortium of the tumor entities malignant melanoma, glioma, sarcoma, lung cancer and chronic lymphocytic leukemia and prospectively collects samples that are profiled using high-throughput methods. Our goal is to identify a reduced set of AHR activity markers that are specific to the different tumor entities and allow the development of simple assays for the clinic. Translating the transcriptional AHR signature to proteomics data will enable immunohistochemical evaluation by pathology laboratories, while extension to metabolomics data may enable translation to biological fluids such as blood and urine that can be obtained without surgical intervention. In summary, PredictAHR will investigate the predictive power of the AHR signature in various cancers and develop assays for AHR activity that can be integrated into the clinic.
