1330	3935	Student assistant in phoniatrics and pediatric audiology (m/f/d)	In our interdisciplinary department, we develop new methods in clinical research that will allow objective voice diagnostics in the future. The quantitative analysis of endoscopic high-speed recordings of the movement of the vocal folds should be emphasized here. Basic research focuses on fundamental physical interactions during vocalization based on Fluid-Structure-Acoustic Interaction (FSAI). Using numerical (spring-mass and also 3D finite-volume models) and experimental (synthetic silicone vocal folds and ex-vivo cadaveric animal larynx) methods, we investigate the relationship between stimulating airflow, vocal fold movement and resulting acoustics for physiological and pathological processes in the larynx. Since 2016 we have been dealing with the molecular-biological analysis of vocal fold tissue. All of this should lead to improved diagnosis and therapy for our patients in the future. Current methods of machine learning (artificial intelligence) are used to develop future quantitative diagnostic methods.
