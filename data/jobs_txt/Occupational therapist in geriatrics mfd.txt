MOVE MORE TOGETHER IN REHAB

Welcome to the Neurological Rehabilitation Center Leipzig, not far from the city gates of Leipzig. The rehabilitation clinic for up to 240 patients with all neurological and neurosurgical diagnoses in rehabilitation phases B, C and D is embedded in idyllic forests, not far from quarries and lakes. It is part of the Michels Kliniken. We work hand in hand in multi-professional and interdisciplinary teams from different professional groups to pave the way for people to return to a largely independent life. We live collegial cohesion, short decision-making processes and development opportunities.

Become part of the team at NRZ Leipzig as a career starter or already with experience and work with us to rebuild geriatric rehabilitation at this location. We are now offering you a full-time or part-time position at the Bennewitz site
