For this reason, STRABAG has its own group academy, in which we not only impart company-specific know-how, but also offer further training in the areas of managerial and personality development, technology, IT and law. In addition, there are tailor-made training series on the topics of construction management and project management.

The offer is supplemented by seminars, lectures and workshops on topics such as exercise, ergonomics and nutrition.
