WHAT YOU DO WITH US
As the right hand of the team management, you always keep track of things when they are not in the branch. Otherwise, like the other team members, you take care of the cash register and our goods - be it clearing away, presenting or reducing.

WHAT TO BRING
Maybe you don't know all the details of retail, but you have already gained some experience. If you want to contribute these with motivation and fun at work, you've come to the right place.

WE MAKE SURE OF THAT
The most important things first: A secure job with a permanent contract - and a great team that supports and trains you.
And if you ever want to take on new tasks or take on more responsibility, we would be happy to give you the chance.

DO YOU HAVE ANYMORE QUESTIONS?
Please feel free to call your contact person (m/f/d). Our colleagues (m/f/d) can be reached Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.
