3556	6161	Computer Scientist - Database Development, MySQL, Data Science	DEUTSCHEFACHPFLEGE is an association of three care groups, Bonitas, the German specialist care group and the bipG group, which together cover the entire spectrum of care throughout Germany. Our goal since the first step: to improve the condition of the people entrusted to us, ideally to the point of full recovery. The synergy effects are in the foreground of the cooperation, because this means that DF is one thing above all: STRONG TOGETHER. Thanks to this strategy, our group has been a leading provider in the German care market for years. The history of company mergers has resulted in a variety of system landscapes, infrastructures and business processes. Further developing this in a future-oriented, efficient and group-compliant manner is a core competence for the group and one of the most important value levers for the further success of the company. In order for everything to work when dealing with our clients, it is important that the administration in the background also runs smoothly. We are therefore looking for someone to support our IT department in Herford as soon as possible
