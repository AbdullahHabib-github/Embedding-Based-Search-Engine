WHAT YOU DO WITH US
Let's not kid ourselves: Your main tasks are cash registers and storing goods, but you will also have other activities related to goods. And of course
support the branch where it is necessary - don't worry, it's not rocket science.

WHAT TO BRING
If you already have experience in sales or retail, that's great!
But it also works without it â€“ we will train you. It is important for us that you show commitment and keep a cool head even in stressful situations.

WE MAKE SURE OF THAT
The most important things first: A secure job with a permanent contract - and a great team that supports and trains you.
And if you ever want to take on new tasks or take on more responsibility, we would be happy to give you the chance.

DO YOU HAVE ANYMORE QUESTIONS?
Please feel free to call your contact person (m/f/d). Our colleagues (m/f/d) can be reached Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.
