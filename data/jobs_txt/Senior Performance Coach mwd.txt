company profile
PageContracting is one of the fastest growing business areas within the PageGroup. Our core business is the placement of highly qualified specialists, who we place on a project-related basis in our customer companies in the areas of finance, IT and engineering on a freelance basis.

We advise our corporate customers on personnel changes and candidates on the design of their project-oriented careers. As the shortage of skilled workers on the German labor market worsened, more and more companies are relying on qualified interim managers to deal with special entrepreneurial challenges. We want to use this market potential by having the PageGroup place a strong focus on the PageContracting division of its entrepreneurial activities and achieving exponential growth through strategic investments and the promotion of our employees.
