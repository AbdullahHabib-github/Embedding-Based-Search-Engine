4641	7246	Senior Consultant Online Marketing & Social Media (m/w/d)	WHAT YOU CAN LOOK FORWARD TO WITH US: When it comes to advice and creation, we act with our customers on an equal footing - with each other too, by the way: With us you will find short decision-making processes, flexible scope for action and plenty of space for your ideas and further development. Whether trainee or board member, your colleagues are real personalities, who all learn something new every day through an open exchange on challenging topics and surpass themselves together: They are moms and dads, people who love to travel, musicians, headbangers, nerds... What unites us ? We are people with team spirit, high self-motivation and enthusiasm for digital topics. Curious? Then take a look and get to know a few faces. WHAT ELSE YOU CAN EXPECT FROM US:
Further development is very important to us. Whether in our own nexum academy, external training courses, conferences or certifications. In addition, we give you the freedom for R&D.

We open up perspectives and offer creative solutions through "cross-functional teams". But also create a professional home in competence teams and interest groups for a modern development environment.

The result counts! Since we know that sometimes you have to be spontaneous, we offer flexible working hours and mobile working. Mac or Windows? take your pick

What else is there? A great team with whom you can get on the SUP right after work in Hamburg and paddle a lap across the Alster, meet in one of the most beautiful inner courtyards in Cologne or ring in the end of the day on the roof terrace in Nuremberg.WHAT YOU WILL DO WITH US:
 • As a lead consultant, you are responsible for all of your customer's digital measures and link them in a meaningful way
 • You will design campaigns and measures, present them to customers and implement them in a team
 • The realization of measures with the support of colleagues from design, editing and development is just as important to you as the brainstorming itself
 • You always keep the business goals of our customers in mind and question the status quo
 • As a digital native, you follow trends and ask yourself what could be exciting for customers.
 • As a creative person, you don't lose yourself in brainstorming, but work in a goal-oriented and efficient manner
 • You are actively involved in pitches to drive sales business forward

YOU ARE...
 • willing to take responsibility
 • Independent, both in the development of ideas and in finding concrete measures
 • curious about new technologies and communication platforms and have a great passion for digital things
 • able to combine creativity and analytical thinking

YOU HAVE...
 • several years of professional experience in digital marketing and customer service
 • ideally a degree in economics/media sciences or a comparable education
 • a great deal of knowledge about the mechanics of online marketing, social media and the media mix
 • At least basic knowledge of the possibilities of media buying in social networks
 • A wide range: from large, time-limited brand and product campaigns to regular, small campaigns in the support business

YOU KNOW YOUR WAY...
 • with large brands and companies (medium-sized companies/corporations) on the customer side in the B2C and B2B areas
 • in the independent creation of concepts and strategies as well as the design and management of customer workshops
 • in customer management, have very good consulting skills, are assertive and have strong communication and presentation skills

Of course these things are important to us. However, if you are not so sure about one point, but have other interesting skills or specialist topics that you would like to bring to us and develop further, let's exchange ideas together.

INTEREST? THEN YOU ARE JUST A CLICK AWAY FROM US: For us, communication at eye level means that you can address us as we can address you. Since we're on first-name terms here at nexum and you might soon be one of them: start with your application right away.

At the same time, we want to make it as easy as possible for you, so a cover letter is not mandatory for us. Just send us your CV in two minutes. That's it. QUESTIONS? NO PROBLEM AT ALL: Clicking the “Apply now” button will take you automatically to the contact form, which you can also use to pester us with questions. We will then contact you personally immediately. Of course you can also use the phone, just give us a call.

We look forward to your message or application!
