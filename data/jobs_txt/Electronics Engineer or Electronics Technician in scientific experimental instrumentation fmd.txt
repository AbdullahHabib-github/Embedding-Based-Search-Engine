Job description

Would you like to contribute to cutting-edge research topics in quantum technologies through your work? Then the research department Quantum Systems at Leibniz-IPHT is the right place for you! On the one hand, we are researching new types of quantum sensor technology, e.g. for measuring biomagnetic signals such as the heart or brain, for searching for exotic matter or deposits of minerals with high-tech metals. On the other hand, we work with new superconducting circuits as an important platform for the realisation of quantum technological applications in the field of quantum computing and simulation, quantum metrology and quantum-based imaging.

The research department is integrated into leading research networks throughout Germany and the world. In our state-of-the-art laboratories, you will work together with scientists from all over the world at the highest level and support us in sustainably transferring the new quantum technologies into real use! You will work with us at the interface of physics, mathematics, materials science and engineering.

Your field of activity:

• Concept development, realisation and optimisation of new electronic measurement and control devices for the operation of research facilities,
• Development and commissioning of low-noise analogue circuits for data acquisition at the physical-technical limit,
• Design and commissioning of programmable control electronics and digital data acquisition devices for scientific tasks,
• Participation in the electronic and mechanical design and construction of new experiments,
• Design and implementation of electromechanical set-ups and high-precision measurement devices,
• Advising scientific staff on electronic measurement tasks,
• Maintenance and repair of electronic equipment.

Your qualification:

• Completed university studies (diploma or master&#39;s degree) in electrical engineering or related disciplines or successfully completed vocational training as an electronics technician (f/m/d) or mechatronic technician (f/m/d) or in a comparable electrotechnical field of activity.

Your knowledge and skills:

• Several years of experience in the above-mentioned field of activity desirable,
• Precise, independent work according to formwork plan or drawing,
• Technical understanding and manual dexterity,
• Good knowledge of German and English,
• Confident handling of software packages for PCB development and design of mechanical components (CAD) as well as in MS Office.

We offer:

• An open welcoming culture as well as a familiar and committed team,
• Working in an interdisciplinary and up-to-date research environment,
• Comprehensive training offers and individual opportunities for personal and professional development,
• Optimal conditions for work-life balance and a family-friendly corporate policy,
• Company health management, capital-forming benefits and offer of a company pension scheme
• Flexible working time models as well as 30 days of holiday/year, annual special payment, bridge days and much more.
• Jena – City of Science: A young and lively town with a vibrant local cultural agenda!

Salary:

Salary is in accordance with the regulations of the TV-L.
