The family-friendly culture and shopping towns of Lörrach, Rheinfelden and Schopfheim await you with a wide range of leisure activities, excellent cuisine and a very special flair.

With around 35,000 inpatients treated every year and 2,000 employees, we are the number one contact point for patients and one of the largest employers in the region. Through targeted structural development, we are concentrating on defined service areas at our four locations in Lörrach, Rheinfelden and Schopfheim. As a result, patients benefit from a particularly wide range of services and employees benefit from comprehensive further training and specialization opportunities.

The clinics in the district of Lörrach and the St. Elisabethen Hospital have set out on the "Lörracher Weg 2.0" in order to offer first-class medical services with the most modern equipment for patients in the district of Lörrach in a large hospital with a good 650 beds in 2025.
