For us, this is not an exclusion criterion. On the contrary - with the experience you have already gained, you can start a shortened apprenticeship at Gödde. Instead of three years, the training period is only 2 years.

Apprenticeship at Gödde

During the training you will gain insight into all areas of a wholesale company - from procurement to direct customer contact.

In addition to the theory learned at vocational school, the practical training gives you the opportunity to apply what you have learned in the company and to work increasingly independently.
