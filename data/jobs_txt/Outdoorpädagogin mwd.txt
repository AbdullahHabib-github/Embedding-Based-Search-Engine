We have been part of the Eltern & Kind Kliniken working group since 2014, which is Germany's largest private provider of mother/father & child cures.

Mothers, fathers and their children aged 2 to 12 are admitted to our clinic for a 3-week preventive measure. The medical-therapeutic range of indications is very diverse and includes, among other things, psychosomatic-psychovegetative diseases, metabolic diseases such as obesity and respiratory diseases in children. Selected focus treatments tailored to specific target groups round off the holistic therapeutic offer.

A special highlight is the animal-assisted intervention with llamas, alpacas, goats and rabbits, which are housed on the clinic premises. An educational outdoor concept for children is also offered in our Miki Adventure Land.

A team of around 160 employees in the fields of medicine, therapy, administration, the hotel industry and child and youth care work hand in hand for the benefit of patients big and small.

With us you will find a friendly working environment with a strong sense of collegiality, with flat hierarchies enabling short decision-making processes.
