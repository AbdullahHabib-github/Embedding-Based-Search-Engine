Determining and predicting the lifespan of lithium-ion batteries is complex. This is mainly due to a large number of physical and electrochemical processes and their interactions, which ultimately lead to degradation of the cell. Consequences of battery aging are reflected in a decrease in available capacity and an increase in internal resistance, which ultimately leads to a decrease in performance.


What awaits you?

- Creation and implementation of electrochemical simulation models to describe the aging phenomenon of cells.
- The practical use focuses on the extension of the existing aging models.
- Validations should then be performed to compare the simulation results with another set of endurance or fast charge measurements.


what do you bring

- Knowledge of lithium-ion batteries.
- Knowledge of Comsol and Matlab/Simulink.
- High degree of independence/initiative.


What do we offer you?

- Comprehensive mentoring & onboarding.
- Personal & professional development.
