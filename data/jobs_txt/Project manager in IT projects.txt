9231	11836	Project manager: in IT projects	As the rail infrastructure company of Deutsche Bahn, DB Netz AG is responsible for the roughly 33,000-kilometer route network with over 46,000 employees. This puts us at the forefront of European rail infrastructure operators for passenger and freight transport. As an innovative and future-oriented company, we create the conditions for safe, environmentally friendly and sustainable mobility and form the backbone of rail transport in Germany.

We are looking for you as a project consultant: in IT projects (f/m/d) for DB Netz AG in Frankfurt (Main) as soon as possible.
This is a "anywhere you want job": In coordination with your manager, you can plan your place of work within Germany yourself and choose between mobile work and work in the office.
Current developments in rail transport (especially increasing transport demand and intensive construction activity) are leading to increasing capacity bottlenecks on the German rail network. New approaches are therefore required, which in future will increasingly focus on the continuous optimization of capacity planning with digitally supported processes. These new approaches are being developed in the KaZu Novum project. Mathematical optimization methods are intended to achieve and demonstrate better utilization of the existing infrastructure. Algorithms already in use from the timetable creation during the year are to be further developed within the framework of KaZu Novum in such a way that an improved IT-supported timetable creation is also possible in advance (more than a year before the train journey). The KaZu Novum project combines many projects in terms of multi-program management or project portfolio management into one unit and controls them in terms of adherence to schedules, achievement of goals, quality, risks, dependencies and budget. KaZu Novum is thus one of the most challenging and exciting projects of DB Netz AG and influences the everyday work of many people
