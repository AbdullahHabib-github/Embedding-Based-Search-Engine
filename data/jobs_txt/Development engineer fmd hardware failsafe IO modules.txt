8964	11569	Development engineer (f/m/d) hardware failsafe I/O modules	Develop what is important tomorrow. We at DI Factory Automation are innovation leaders in automation. With a comprehensive range of high-performance industrial products and software and consistently integrated automation technologies, we support manufacturing companies in increasing flexibility and efficiency in their manufacturing processes and enabling new products to enter the market faster.
We realize what counts.
- Become part of the product development of fail-safe modules for programmable logic controllers (PLC) and find the best solution taking into account objectives, environmental conditions and suitability for large-scale production.
- As part of the team, you will develop sustainable concepts, boldly bring in new ideas and ensure their sustainable feasibility.
- In addition to your work in electronics hardware design, you will take care of the layout, organize the prototyping and work closely with the firmware development and take over the commissioning.
- You implement tests accompanying development, supervise type testing and transfer the products to production.
- In all development phases you take into account the requirements of functional safety and are also responsible for the implementation of the cFMEDA on electronic circuits.
- You are aware of the importance of proper documentation of all development steps, including worst-case analyses.
- In close cooperation with SCM (Supply Chain Management) and Customer Service, you also support the care of the products that are currently being delivered.


Use your skills to move the world forward.
- The basis of your success is a degree in information technology, communications technology, communications engineering, automation technology, electrical engineering or comparable training.
- You already have initial professional experience in circuit design for digital and analog technology, controller applications, onboard power supplies including dimensioning and simulation.
- You know how to design and implement assemblies and PCB layouts including signal integrity and EMC-compliant design.
- You are familiar with the handling of measurement technology (e.g. oscilloscopes, signal generators, etc.).
- You have the skills to build and repair patterns.
- You have an understanding of the need for functional safety and would like to further develop and apply your knowledge in this area. Ideally, you already have knowledge of the relevant standards such as IEC 61508, ISO 13849, IEC 62061 and their implementation in hardware design.
- You use PC-based tools (office applications, circuit diagram input, database systems, simulation programs) reliably and efficiently.
- If you also have experience in hardware-related firmware development and knowledge of the function of programmable logic controllers and their programming, you meet our ideal requirements.


You match us if:
- You have a passion for technology and you keep up to date with trends in your field.
