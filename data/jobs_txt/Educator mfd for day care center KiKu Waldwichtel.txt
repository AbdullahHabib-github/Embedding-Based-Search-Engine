• You can deal with feedback and complaints and have good reflection skills.
• You enjoy organizing and designing events and day-to-day daycare.
• You don't shy away from taking on nursing and household chores, but rather lend a hand and take on responsibility.
• You don't run out of breath right away, even when things get turbulent.
• You enjoy working in a team, get involved in team meetings or take part in network meetings.
• You like to share your knowledge and experience, e.g. B. as part of the induction of new colleagues.
• You are interested in the further development of the pedagogical quality, as well as in your personal and professional development.
• You've got humour. Do you need.
