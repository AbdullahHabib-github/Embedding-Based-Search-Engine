We have been delighting our guests with good service and fresh, Mediterranean cuisine since 1999. Our tapas counters are richly filled with the finest delicacies, with the famous air-dried Serrano ham hanging above them.
In 2017/18, Las Tapas at the Frauenkirche was repeatedly voted the best Spanish restaurant in Dresden. Our delivery service for tapas and montaditos in the Altmarkt Galerie is the first and only one of its kind in Germany.
